# Weather FX
This module automatic generate weather effects on canvas (in the current scene) using [FX Master](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fxmaster) module API and [Weather Control](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/weather-control) weather generation messages.

Weather FX also provides weather conditions according to the current weather, based on the (now deprecated) Weather Effects 5e module.

## Functions
With the buttons added to the controls on the right side of the screen the GM can either remove or apply Weather FX.

The GM is able to disable Weather FX in any scene. This is useful to prevent to add weather effects in very large scenes that may cause lag.

## Settings
**Weather Source**

Now Weather FX also supports SmallWeather, you only have to select it in the module settings and save.  

**Automatic Apply**  
*Default: active*  
Self explainable, you can have Weather FX auto apply on, thus Weather effects will be applied to the current scene as soon as they are generated by Weather Control.

**D&D5e Weather Conditions**  
*Default: disabled*  
Have Weather FX to roll weather conditions to the chat. Currently only available for DnD5e.

**Enable Sound**
