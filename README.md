# Weather FX
This module automatic generate weather effects on canvas (in the current scene) using [FX Master](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/fxmaster) module API and [Weather Control](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/weather-control) weather generation messages.

Weather FX also provides weather conditions according to the current weather, based on the (now deprecated) Weather Effects 5e module.

## Functions
With the buttons added to the controls on the right side of the screen the GM can either remove or apply Weather FX.

## Settings
**Automatic Apply**  
Self explainable, you can have Weather FX auto apply on, thus Weather effects will be applied to the current scene as soon as they are generated by Weather Control.

**Enable Sound**  
Weather FX also play sounds if you have this option on. The defaults sounds come from the modules Ivan Duch's Music Packs and Michael Ghelfi Studios Audio Pack, although you can customize these in the settings bellow.
