- Now Weather FX is more well adjusted to the data received from smallweather, creating effects that are true to the data.
- Effects now account for:
    - wind direction;
    - wind speed;
    - real precipitation values
    - real cloud cover values
- Also it is now possible to use the new feature: instant apply. This will redraw the scene so you won't have to wait for the effects to transition. This setting is off by default.
- You can now choose between top-down rain or regular foundry's rain. This setting works only with smallweather as weather source.
